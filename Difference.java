1. Difference between List, Set, and Map

List: Ordered collection, allows duplicates. Indexed access (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList).

Set: Unordered collection, does not allow duplicates (e.g., HashSet, TreeSet).

Map: Stores key-value pairs. Keys are unique, values can be duplicate (e.g., HashMap, TreeMap).
